# InuzDev's Java lab

Hey! What you sniffing around!? This is my Java lab. Here I study and learn about Java development.

To run the code I use `javac -d out src/main/java/lab/InuzDev/Main.java` in the terminal and to run it `java -cp out lab.InuzDev.Main`.

## Stage 1 - Hello World and familiarization

I start with "Hello World" program or similar. I will then study more attributes and advantages of Java, keeping this update as I learn.
